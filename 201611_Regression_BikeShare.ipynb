    "We're going to work with bike share data.  This is an environmentally friendly solution to the \"last mile\" problem that people working in urban planning talk about. The challenge is that public transit is excellent for thoroughfares, but most people have about a mile at one or the other or both ends of their journey that does not easily connect to public transit.  Many people choose to drive rather than walk that last mile or take an out-of-the-way bus route that takes an additional portion of an hour.  If we want people to use environmentally sustainable methods of transit that do not hurt the planet, we can provide bikes to people leaving transit areas and every block or two blocks in a city.  This is bike share.\n",
    "\n",
    "But for bike share to work, you need to know how many bikes are needed, and where they are needed. (There are redistribution methods going on all day long -- people's jobs are to load bikes onto trucks and move them around the city to match expectations about needs, and there's a big logistics AI challenge in figuring out the optimal path through the city to do redistribution the most efficiently and with the least environmental impact.)  We're going to look at the first question in this notebook."
