    "  * Read the documentation about the variables online if you haven't already -- knowing your data always helps.\n",

    "  * Vary how variables are bucketed and see how performance is affected.\n",
    "  * Think about and include some new features based directly on information in your training data.  (Maybe information from their names, like presence of \"O'\" or \"ski\" -- this could get at the effect of ethnicity on survival? Maybe information derived from their cabin assigment or lack thereof? Something else?)\n",
    "  * If you create entirely new features (like \"is a female with a cheap fare\" or \"number of family members on board\"), does that help performance?\n",
    "  * If you had to choose just a single variable to build a model on, what would it be? How well would it do?\n",
    "  * Can you interpret what the current model is doingn into English?  What sorts of things does the model indicate are driving survival?\n",
    "  \n",
    "And if you're feeling very bold:\n",
    "  * Can you figure out any ways to fill in `NaN` values with reasonable guesses based on the other information we have?\n",
    "  * Can you write the code that applies the model you learned on the training data to the test data? (This requires reading in a new file, transforming it in exactly the same way as your previous data, and running your trained model against the new data. The output file format that Kaggle wants is a .csv file with two headers: PassengerId and Survived.  The file `genderclassmodel.csv` on their website is in the format they need for submissions.)\n",
    "  * What does the `alpha` parameter to the `BernoulliNB` model do in the [docs](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.BernoulliNB.html)?  Is it helpful to use `alpha`? (Try googling for the terms in the description alongside the word \"Naive Bayes\", maybe with a helpful term like \"example\" thrown in.)\n",
    "  * Instead of predicting survival, can you predict sex?\n",
    "\n",
    "In favor of getting you a deep understanding of Naive Bayes, we skipped over some general modeling \"musts\" that we'll touch on more in the future.  These include: (1) don't ever look at your test data, (2) cross-validation is your friend, and (3) there are better scoring metrics than accuracy.  Don't worry about these for now -- we will get there.  But if you're done with everything else and still thirsting for more, you might also try googing for explanations of these."
